The club started in the winter of 2017-18 when our very first set of equipment got built in the kantine at Unity. After a few years of playing and a global pandemic, we were officially founded as a folkeoplysende forening on January 29, 2022. We now play weekly together in downtown Copenhagen, and we regularly visit other countries for tournaments and trainings—especially Germany and Sweden.

This page hosts some of the history and official information about the club.

Being a "forening," the club’s highest authority is the General Assembly. THis is where you, the members, propose, discuss, and vote on various issues. These issues are often presented by the board, who receive the GA’s mandate to run the club’s day-to-day organization. See [Constitution]() below for more details.

# Board of directors

The board takes care of the club’s day-to-day administration, finances, organization, and more.

# Code of conduct

We are a diverse group of people who are interested in having a good time. Here are some things about how we play:

1. Everyone should have fun!
2. We welcome and respect people of all nationalities, gender identities and expressions, religions, sexual orientations, abilities, etc.
3. We stand up for each other against "assholes" and rude, aggresive, or disrespectful behavior.
4. We hit gently and in a controlled manner.
5. We resolve problems on the field. If this does not work, we discuss it with the board as soon as possible, who have the final say.

By hanging out with us, you agree that you’ll abide by these guidelines. Failure to comply with the code of conduct may lead to your membership being suspended temporarily or indefinitely or, at worst, having to play double-shorts for a month.

The club’s leadership consists of the board members listed above. Any board member is empowered to resolve disagreements and enforce the code of conduct on or off the field.
