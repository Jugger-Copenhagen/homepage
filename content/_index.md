Weâ€™re Denmarkâ€™s first official jugger club! Jugger is a 5v5 team field sport that plays like competitive LARP: blending elements of fencing, rugby, and capture-the-flag.

Want to know more? Jugger in 45 seconds and A Game of Jugger demonstrate the basic rules and gameplay.

The club started in the winter of 2017-18 when our very first set of equipment got built in the kantine at Unity. After a few years of playing and a global pandemic, we were officially founded as a folkeoplysende forening on January 29, 2022. We now play weekly together in downtown Copenhagen, and we regularly visit other countries for tournaments and trainingsâ€”especially Germany and Sweden.

Weâ€™re excited to share the sport and culture of jugger with you. ðŸ˜Š
