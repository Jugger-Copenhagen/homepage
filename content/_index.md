We’re Denmark’s first official jugger club! Jugger is a 5v5 team field sport that plays like competitive LARP: blending elements of fencing, rugby, and capture-the-flag.

*This is an intro text that provides a brief overview of Jugger and this website.*

<!-- The club started in the winter of 2017-18 when our very first set of equipment got built in the kantine at Unity. After a few years of playing and a global pandemic, we were officially founded as a folkeoplysende forening on January 29, 2022. We now play weekly together in downtown Copenhagen, and we regularly visit other countries for tournaments and trainings—especially Germany and Sweden. -->

We’re excited to share the sport and culture of jugger with you. 😊
