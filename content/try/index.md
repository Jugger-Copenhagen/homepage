New players are always welcome! When you join us for the first time, please arrive 15 minutes early and tell us two days beforehand at [juggercopenhagen@gmail.com](mailto:juggercopenhagen@gmail.com); weâ€™ll get you up to speed. ðŸ™‚

Jugger is a relatively new sport, so very few players who join us have previous experience. We are excited to teach you. You can try jugger out for 2 practices free of charge before deciding if you want to join.

We play every Saturday near Trianglen Metro Station; the calendar below has times and map points. Have a peek at photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/juggercph/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JuggerCopenhagen/)!

## What to bring?

Wear sporty clothes (sneakers if inside, sneakers or plastic cleats if outside, a t-shirt, and shorts; kneepads are also nice) and bring water, we do the rest!
