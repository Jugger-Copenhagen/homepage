Jugger is a relatively new sport, so very few players who join us have previous experience. We are excited to teach you. 🧑🏽‍🏫 We play every Saturday near Trianglen Metro Station; the calendar below has times and map points. Have a peek at photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/juggercph/) or videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JuggerCopenhagen/)!

### Want to try it out?
New players are always welcome! When you join us for the first time, please arrive 15 minutes early and [contact us](/#contact) two days beforehand ; we’ll get you up to speed. 😊 You are welcome to attend two practices free of charge before deciding if you want to join. Wear sporty clothes (sneakers if inside, sneakers or plastic cleats if outside, a t-shirt, and shorts; kneepads are also nice) and bring water, we do the rest!
