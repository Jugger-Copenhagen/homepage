Jugger is a 5v5 team field sport that plays like competitive LARP: blending elements of fencing, rugby, and capture-the-flag.

Want to know more? [Jugger in 45 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5KGov_Sajs) and [A Game of Jugger](https://vimeo.com/77880281) demonstrate the basic rules and gameplay.

We’re Denmark’s first official jugger club! The club started in the winter of 2017-18 when our very first set of equipment got built in the kantine at Unity. After a few years of playing and a global pandemic, we were officially founded as a folkeoplysende forening on January 29, 2022. We now play weekly together in downtown Copenhagen, and we regularly visit other countries for tournaments and trainings—especially Germany and Sweden. We look forward to seeing you on the pitch!
