## How we travel

### Who gets to be on the team?
When we travel as {{< skÃ¸ll >}}, we try to bring ~7 people with us to a tournament. We give first priority to our own team, based on who signs up using the year's signup form. We don't have "tryouts" for this, we just take the first 7 who make a firm commitment to attend. If we don't get 7 players from our own team, we will search for "mercenaries" from other teams.

For very nearby tournaments, like Kieler Nordderby in April, we ask players to put down a 50 DKK deposit as soon as they know they want to attend: we'll then take the first 7 who put down the deposit. This will be announced in the group. The deposit will then go towards food at the tournament, and helps us ensure that we give spots to players who are definitely going to attend.

### How much does it cost?
Jugger Copenhagen will pay for:
* tournament fees
* transport of pompfen to and from the tournament (someone will have to pay for this upfront and get reimbursed)

You must pay for:
* your own transportation to and from the tournament location
* your own lodging at the tournament location (many tournaments provide free or cheap places to set a tent or sleeping bag)
* your own food (see below)
* deposit, if applicable

The cost of these varies widely depending on where the tournament is held, but going to Kiel is normally <800 DKK all-in.

### How does tournament food work?
We typically do a group purchase of food and snacks at the tournament so that everyone has things to eat on the field. This is coordinated by one of the senior people/trainer team who are attending, and the cost is split between the people who attend, with the deposit dealt with if required. When you are added to a group for a tournament, let us know if you have food allergies/restrictions so we can plan.

### What should I bring to a tournament?
For on the field:
* shoes or cleats (we'll note whether a pitch is grass, turf, or sand so you can plan)
* {{< skÃ¸ll >}} jersey (plus extras if you want to trade)
* shorts, tights, or whatever you usually wear
* socks
* water bottle
* rain gear and/or thermal gear if the forecast calls for it
* sunscreen and lip balm

For off the field:
* clean clothes, including a sweatshirt (often we hang out outdoors for several hours after games; keep that in mind as you pack)
* non-pitch shoes
* towel, shower, and hygeine materials
* camping cup, plate, and silverware for yourself
* tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping mat (as required)
* sleep mask and earplugs (as desired)
* medications (as required)
