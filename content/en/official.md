The club started in the winter of 2017-18 when our very first set of equipment got built in the kantine at Unity. After a few years of playing and a global pandemic, we were officially founded as a folkeoplysende forening on January 29, 2022. We are based in Københavns Kommune and are a member of DGI. Our club is headed by a board of 5 and an auditor. For 2024, they are:

* Valkyrie Savage (chair)
* Martin Schmitz (vice chair)
* Karel Proesmans (treasurer)
* Evan Savage
* Luca Bune Jensen
* Jim Wang (auditor)

As a forening, the club’s highest authority is the General Assembly. This is where you, the members, propose, discuss, and vote on various issues. These issues are often presented by the board, who receive the GA’s mandate to run the club’s day-to-day organization.

Our players and those who visit us are bound by our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_ZWrU9rb1hDyrfI6IjGW24BFYPfaNhS7D3A-cSOaco/edit), and our organization is run according to [our constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13gHCvyobzfLGX1JKa7vSJnOykByL8NtlArcgXXLmaQA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Groups within the Club
Our club requires a lot of work to run! We currently rely on a few groups of volunteers to keep things moving:

* the quartermasters keep our gear in shape and build new equipment. Talk to Martin, Sophie, or Hannah if you are interested in joining.
* the trainers run our practice sessions, as well as events with externals. Talk to Evan, Valkyrie, Sophie, Cajetan, or Michael if you are interested in joining.
* the tournament organization team put together the first-ever Danish jugger tournament, 2024's [PB&J](https://turniere.jugger.org/list.team.info.php?id=1387). Talk to Valkyrie, Evan, or Luca if you are interested in helping organize the next one!

## Code of Conduct
We are a diverse group of people who are interested in having a good time. Here are some things about how we play:

* we have fun!
* we welcome people of all nationalities, gender identities and expressions, religions, sexual orientations, abilities, etc., but not assholes
* we hit gently (you’ll soon find this is more effective than hard swings, anyway)
* if there’s a problem we can’t solve ourselves on the field, we talk it over with the club leadership* as soon as possible, who have the final say

By hanging out with us, you agree that you’ll abide by these guidelines. Looking forward to seeing you on the pitch!


* Our club leadership is Valkyrie, Martin, Evan, Jim, Karel and Luca. We are in charge in that order, and the most senior person from the list is empowered to make/enforce any necessary decisions on or off the field.
