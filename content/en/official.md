The club started in the winter of 2017-18 when our very first set of equipment got built in the kantine at Unity. After a few years of playing and a global pandemic, we were officially founded as a folkeoplysende forening on January 29, 2022. We are based in Københavns Kommune and are a member of DGI. Our club is headed by a board of 3-5 and an auditor. For 2025, they are:

* Cajetan Koschat (chair)
* Valkyrie Savage (vice chair)
* Luca Victoria Bune Jensen (treasurer)
* Sophie Marie Ehgartner
* Jim Wang (auditor)

As a forening, the club’s highest authority is the General Assembly. This is where you, the members, propose, discuss, and vote on various issues. These issues are often presented by the board, who receive the GA’s mandate to run the club’s day-to-day organization.

Our players and those who visit us are bound by our Code of Conduct (below), and our organization is run according to [our constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13gHCvyobzfLGX1JKa7vSJnOykByL8NtlArcgXXLmaQA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Groups within the Club
Our club requires a lot of work to run! We currently rely on a few groups of volunteers to keep things moving:

* the quartermasters keep our gear in shape and build new equipment. Talk to Sophie or Martin if you are interested in joining.
* the trainers run our practice sessions, as well as events with externals. Talk to Evan, Valkyrie, Sophie, Cajetan, Billie, or Michael if you are interested in joining.
* the tournament organization team put together the first-ever Danish jugger tournament, 2024's [PB&J](https://turniere.jugger.org/list.team.info.php?id=1387). Talk to Valkyrie, Evan, or Luca if you are interested in helping organize the next one!

We are a diverse group of people who are interested in having a good time. Here are some things about how we play:

* We want everyone to have fun!
* We welcome and respect people of all nationalities, gender identities and expressions, religions, sexual orientations, abilities, etc.
* We stand up for each other against aggressive, dangerous, or disrespectful behavior.
* We play in a controlled manner.  
* We resolve problems through open discussion.
* All members agree to abide by these guidelines. Failure to comply with the code of conduct may lead to membership being suspended temporarily or indefinitely.

Any board member or member of the trainer team is empowered to resolve disagreements and enforce the code of conduct on or off the field.
