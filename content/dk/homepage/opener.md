Jugger is a 5v5 team field sport that plays like competitive rollespil/LARP: blending elements of fencing, rugby, and capture-the-flag.

Want to know more? [Jugger in 45 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5KGov_Sajs) and [A Game of Jugger](https://vimeo.com/77880281) demonstrate the basic rules and gameplay. We use [our own translation of the German rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B77ufGU5-koR5nv8_aQ7Ts92PIj90dc8tjCpHA62xm8) for play.

Jugger Copenhagen is Denmarkâ€™s first official jugger club! We play weekly together in downtown Copenhagen, and our traveling team, {{<skÃ¸ll>}}, regularly visits other countries for [tournaments and trainings](tournaments/)â€”especially Germany and Sweden. We look forward to seeing you on the pitch!
