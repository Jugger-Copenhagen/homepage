 <h2 id="want-to-become-a-member">Want to become a member?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Come to a practice or two and <a href="//172.20.15.198:1313/try/">try it out</a>!</li>
<li>Fill out the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/juggercphregistration">membership registration form</a>.</li>
<li>Pay membership fee (see below).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="membership">Membership</h2>
<p>25 and over: 200 kr. / quarter</p>
<p>Under 25: 120 kr. / quarter</p>
<h3 id="payment-info">Payment info.</h3>
<p>Payments are made by bank transfer.</p>
<p>Within Denmark: 5327-0246710</p>
<p>IBAN: DK4353270000246710 (Arbejdenes Landesbank)</p>
<p>Include your name in the transfer text, so that we can tell who has paid! This makes it a lot easier to keep our membership list up to date ðŸ™‚</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you take MobilePay / Betalingservice?</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately not, as these services are too expensive for a small club like ours. The best option for regular payments is to set up a standing order with your bank to pay each quarter.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What if I join halfway through a quarter?</li>
</ol>
<p>Your first quarter is pro-rated on a per-month basis, at 67 kr. per month.  As an example: if you join May 12, youâ€™ll pay 134 kr. for May and June, then 200 kr. per quarter after that.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What does membership get me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Members can:</p>
<ul>
<li>come to our regular weekly practices;</li>
<li>access our internal Signal group, where we share training photos and discuss upcoming events, decisions, and other things of interest to the club;</li>
<li>participate in our Annual General Meeting, Holiday Party, and other private events;</li>
<li>volunteer to help maintain equipment, organise events, and keep the club running;</li>
<li>run for our Board of Directors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that, your membership dues help us grow the club and keep our equipment in good order.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What if I leave halfway through a quarter?</li>
</ol>
<p>You remain a member until the end of the quarter, at which point your membership will end.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Why do you ask so many questions on the membership signup form, about my address, age, and gender?</li>
</ol>
<p>Jugger Copenhagen is a member of <a href="https://dgi.dk/">DGI</a>, an umbrella organization which promotes sports for all and provides insurance and support to small sports clubs. So that they can track their impacts, all member clubs (that includes us!) must report the ages and genders of their members.</p>
<p>Jugger Copenhagen also receives financial support from KÃ¸benhavns Kommune for youth members. To correctly identify youth members from KK, we must collect age and address data.</p>
<p>We delete your data if you have not been a member for one year at the time of our Annual General Meeting (AGM) in March. If you have data handling concerns, please speak with one of the board members.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What if Iâ€™m just visiting Copenhagen?</li>
</ol>
<p>We always welcome travelling juggers to play with us!  Itâ€™s important to us as a club that our players are exposed to the international jugger community.</p>
<p>Reach out to one of our board members at <a href="mailto:juggercopenhagen@gmail.com">juggercopenhagen@gmail.com</a>.  We can probably also find one of the local players to host you.</p>
