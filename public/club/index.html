<h1 class="page-title"> Club </h1>



 <p>The club started in the winter of 2017-18 when our very first set of equipment got built in the kantine at Unity. After a few years of playing and a global pandemic, we were officially founded as a folkeoplysende forening on January 29, 2022. We now play weekly together in downtown Copenhagen, and we regularly visit other countries for tournaments and trainings—especially Germany and Sweden.</p>
<p>This page hosts some of the history and official information about the club.</p>
<p>Being a &ldquo;forening,&rdquo; the club’s highest authority is the General Assembly. THis is where you, the members, propose, discuss, and vote on various issues. These issues are often presented by the board, who receive the GA’s mandate to run the club’s day-to-day organization. See <a href="">Constitution</a> below for more details.</p>

<li>We welcome and respect people of all nationalities, gender identities and expressions, religions, sexual orientations, abilities, etc.</li>

<li>We resolve problems on the field. If this does not work, we discuss it with the board as soon as possible, who have the final say.</li>
